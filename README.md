<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to&nbsp;<a href="https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/NwGzC3ck-xCcOmVIIbZn9Q" target="_blank" title="explain to anyone">explain to anyone</a>,&nbsp;<strong>without the help of Google</strong>:</p>
<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
    <li>At least four different sorting algorithms</li>
    <li>What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm</li>
    <li>How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input</li>
    <li>What is a stable sorting algorithm</li>
</ul>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Allowed editors:&nbsp;<code>vi</code>,&nbsp;<code>vim</code>,&nbsp;<code>emacs</code></li>
    <li>All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89</li>
    <li>All your files should end with a new line</li>
    <li>A&nbsp;<code>README.md</code> file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory</li>
    <li>Your code should use the&nbsp;<code>Betty</code> style. It will be checked using&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl" target="_blank" title="betty-style.pl">betty-style.pl</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl" target="_blank" title="betty-doc.pl">betty-doc.pl</a></li>
    <li>You are not allowed to use global variables</li>
    <li>No more than 5 functions per file</li>
    <li>Unless specified otherwise, you are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like&nbsp;<em>printf, puts, &hellip;</em> is totally forbidden.</li>
    <li>In the following examples, the&nbsp;<code>main.c</code> files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don&rsquo;t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won&rsquo;t take them into account). We will use our own&nbsp;<code>main.c</code> files at compilation. Our&nbsp;<code>main.c</code> files might be different from the one shown in the examples</li>
    <li>The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called&nbsp;<code>sort.h</code></li>
    <li>Don&rsquo;t forget to push your header file</li>
    <li>All your header files should be include guarded</li>
    <li>A list/array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2.</li>
</ul>
